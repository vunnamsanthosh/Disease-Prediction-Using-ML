# Disease-Prediction-Using-ML

The rise of chronic diseases coupled with the increasing availability of healthcare data has prompted the exploration of machine learning approaches for disease prediction. The objective of this project is to develop robust predictive models that can accurately forecast the occurrence or progression of various diseases based on patient data . This project focuses on predicting the risk of specific diseases, including but not limited to cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders. The scope encompasses the development of predictive models using supervised learning techniques and does not include treatment recommendations or clinical decision-making.
